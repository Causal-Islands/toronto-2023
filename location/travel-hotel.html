          <h2>Getting to Toronto</h2>
          <h3>By Plane</h3>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>YYZ is nuts! But ya gotta. Unless you’re in North America in which case Billy Bishop is your bet. TIP: The UP Express train costs around $12.65 or less depending on the station. The ride from the airport to downtown is 20 minutes. Taxis from the airport are $65+ and driving takes longer than the train.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>By Train</h3>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>If you are travelling from the east coast of North America, Toronto is accessible by train and bus. It’s a slower trip, but far more eco-friendly.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>By Car</h3>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>From an ecological point of view, traveling to Toronto by car is not recommended. If you have no alternative, you can help offset your emissions by filling the car with the maximum number of people permissible, choosing alternative fuels, or using car-sharing platforms.</p>
          <h2>Where to stay</h2>
          <p>We don&#x27;t have an official conference hotel. Our main venue <a href="/location/venue/">Paradise Theater</a> is on Bloor St W next to Koreatown and Little Italy, and easily accessible from the city core hotels, nearby AirBnBs, and other accommodation. </p>
          <p>As a speaker, you should have an invitation to Travel Perk to get you booked in, with a few favourites noted.</p>
