title: Alternative Collective Futures for the Internet
presenter: Jasmine Wang
---
<p id="">Verses is a collective re-imagining the future of the web with participatory software artifacts. Its governance is experimental. This talk is about its work, and how experimentation in organizational structures is essential for the pluriversal world we dream of — different structures allow for different forms of creation (e.g. commons-based peer production). Participants will have a chance to share experiments they’ve conducted or witnessed.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Watch the full talk below:</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foFzZ6VJ34w"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/foFzZ6VJ34w" title="Alternative Collective Futures For The Internet - Jasmine Wang"></iframe></div></figure>
