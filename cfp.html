          <h3>Accepting applications until January 31st</h3>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>The Causal Islands programming committee welcomes you to submit proposals for talks and presentation concepts exploring the future of computing in its many shapes and forms. Is there a notion for a distributed system, storage engine, programming language, or user interface that was proposed back in the ‘70s, ‘80s, or ‘90s but hasn’t been developed yet? Do you want to share your own work or research that revolutionizes the way we interact with data, computers, the climate, medicine, and/or each other? Have there been themes and ideas around computing that have been sorely overlooked that you’d like to share with us? We want to hear from you.</p>
          <p>‍<br></p>
          <h4><strong>The only requirements we ask of your talk are to be:</strong></h4>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>tangentially computing-related!</li>
            <li>be about something you view as unique and/or inspiring, and/or magical!<br></li>
          </ul>
          <h4><strong>We would especially like to hear from you if:</strong></h4>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>you’ve never spoken at a tech conference before.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve found that people like you are underrepresented at programming conferences. We&#x27;re committed to making Causal Islands a great experience for you! See our Code of Conduct.</li>
            <li>you’ve found the topics you’re interested in with regard to programming and computing haven’t fit in with topics at other tech conferences.<br></li>
          </ul>
          <p>All talks should be between 30-40 minutes long, but we are amenable to alternatives depending on the idea(s).</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Process and Timeline</h3>
          <ul role="list">
